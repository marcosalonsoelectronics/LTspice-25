Files associated to video LTspice #25: How to Create a Current-Mode Controller for DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/PqD8De54IIs

This video shows how to create a current-mode controller for DC-DC converters. The controller includes a clock, an RS flip-flop, a current comparator, an error amplifier, and the circuitry to add a programmable auxiliary ramp. Several simulation examples on how to use the controller are also shown.
